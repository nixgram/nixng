As contributors and maintainers of the nixng project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues,
updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of nixng's channels (GitHub, Discord, Gitter, IRC, mailing lists, Twitter, etc.) must be
